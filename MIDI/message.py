""" MESSAGE TYPES """
"""-------------------------------------------------------------------"""

NOTE_OFF = 0x80
# Note Off. This message is sent when a note is stopped.

NOTE_ON = 0x90
# Note On. This message is sent when a note is started.

POLY_KEY_PRES = 0xA0
# Polyphonic Key Pressure (Aftertouch). This message is usually sent by
# pressing down on the key after it has been pressed.

CTRL_CHG = 0xB0
# Control Change. Sent when a controller value changes. Controllers include
# devices such as pedals and levers. Controller numbers 120-127 are reserved as
# "Channel Mode Messages".

PRG_CHG = 0xC0
# Program Change. Sent when a patch number changes.

CH_PRS_AFTT = 0xD0
# Channel Aftertouch. This message is usually sent by pressing down on the
# key after it has been pressed - but it is different from Polyphonic
# Key Pressure (Aftertouch) which is per note. This is per channel - use this
# message to send the single greatest pressure value (of all the currently depressed keys).


PITCH_BND = 0xE0
# Pitch Wheel. This message is sent to indicate a change in the pitch wheel.
# The pitch wheel is measured by a fourteen bit value. Center (no pitch change) is
# 0x2000. Sensitivity is a function of the transmitter

SYS_EX_START = 0xF0
# System Exclusive Start, with data1 being the manufacturer's ID and data2 the data itself.
# This message makes up for all that MIDI doesn't support. Data1 is usually a seven-bit
# Manufacturer's I.D. code. If a device recognizes the I.D. code as its own, it will listen
# to the rest of the message, otherwise it will be ignored. System Exclusive is used to send
# data in bulk, such as patch parameters and other non MIDI spec data. (Note: Only Real-Time
# messages may be interleaved with a System Exclusive.) This message also is used for
# extensions called Universal Exclusive Messages.

MTC = 0xF1
# MIDI Time Code, Quarter Frame

SC_SONG_PTR = 0xF2
# System Common, Song Pointer, with data1 and data2 being LSB and MSB respectively.
# This is an internal 14 bit register that holds the number of MIDI beats(1 beat=six MIDI clock
# messages) since the start of the song.

SC_SONG_SEL = 0xF3
# System Common, Song Select, with data1 being the Song Number, data2 unused

TUNE_REQ = 0xF6
# Tune Request. This is a request of all analog synthesizers to tune their oscillators

SYS_EX_END = 0xF7
# System Exclusive End, data1 and data2 unused

SRT_TM_CLK = 0xF8
# System Realtime, Timing Clock, Sent 24 times per quarter note when synchronization is required

SRT_MEAS_END = 0xF9
# System Realtime, Measure End

SRT_START = 0xFA
# System Realtime, Start the current sequence playing. (This message will be followed with Timing Clocks.)

SRT_CONTINUE = 0xFB
# System Realtime, Continue at the point the sequence was Stopped

SRT_STOP = 0xFC
# System Realtime, Stop the current sequence.

SRT_SENSE = 0xFE
# System Realtime, Active Sensing. Use of this message is optional. When initially sent,
# the receiver will expect to receive another Active Sensing message each 300ms(max), or it will
# be assume that the connection has been terminated. At termination, the receiver will turn off all
# voices and return to normal(non-active sensing) operation.

SRT_RESET = 0xFF
# System Realtime, Reset. Reset all receivers in the system to power-up status. This should be used
# sparingly, preferably under manual control. In particular, it should not be sent on power-up.

BANK = 0x00
# Bank Select (coarse). This is for MIDI devices which have more than 128 Programs.
# MIDI Program Change messages only support switching between 128 programs; Bank Select Controller
# (also called Bank Switch) can be used to allow switching between groups (Banks) of 128 programs.

MODULATION = 0x01
# Modulation Wheel (coarse). Sets the MOD Wheel to a particular value.

BREATH = 0x02
# Breath Controller (coarse). The musician can set this controller to affect what he or she chooses.
# Breath control is a wind player's version of Aftertouch.

FOOT_CTRL = 0x04
# Foot Contoller (coarse). The musician can set this controller to affect what he or she chooses.
# This foot pedal is a continuous controller.

PORTAMENTO_TM = 0x05
# Portamento Time (coarse). The rate at which the pitch slides between two notes.

DATA_ENTRY = 0x06
# Data Entry Slider (coarse). The value of some Registered or Non-Registered Parameter.
# Which parameter is affected depends upon a preceding RPN or NRPN message (which itself identifies the parameter's number).

VOLUME = 0x07
# Main Volume (coarse). The device's volume level.

BALANCE = 0x08
# Stereo Balance (coarse). Affects the device's stereo balance (assuming that the device has stereo audio outputs).

PAN = 0x0A
# Pan (coarse). The Pan (Left/Right) setting for a device. Pan is then used, along with Volume, and Balance controllers to
# internally mix all of the Parts to the device's stereo outputs.

EXPRESSION = 0x0B
# Expression (sub-Volume) (coarse). This is a percentage of the value set by Volume Controller). Expression divides the current
# volume into 16,384 steps (or 128 if 8-bit instead of 14-bit resolution is used). Volume Controller is used to set the overall volume
# of the entire musical part, while Expression is used for crescendos and diminuendos. This message makes it possible to adjust the
# overall volume of a part without having to adjust every single MIDI message comprising a crescendo or diminuendo. When Expression
# is at 100% the volume represents the true setting of Volume Controller. Lower values of Expression subtract from the setting of Volume Controller.
# When Expression is 0% then volume is off. When Expression is 50% then the volume is cut in half. All this is within the upper limit set by Volume Controller.
